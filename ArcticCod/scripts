# tried .1 and the threshold was too low--the line picked up dust and made false outer boundaries. 
# mouse.click doesn't work great: instead try to get cleaner (or well-edited) images to avoid this
# next, trying theshold .2 -- did not work first time for image 1. left only a red dot in the middle of the otolith.
# also gave error that "the otolith is possibly not in the center of the image."

# In summary, differences between dimensions of the left and right sagittae, and then left and right lapilli 
# were measured using a paired t test when distributions were normal and a Wilcoxon test when distributions were not normal. 
# Results found that there were no statistical differences in any of the dimension (area, length, width, or perimeter)
# between the left and right sagittae or between the left and right lapilli, with the exception of sagittal width. 
# These were likely variable between left and right sides due to highly variable lobes along the longest sides of the sagittae,
# which could have resulted in very different widths, while lengths did not vary (lobes did not extend from shortest sides/along longest axis of sagittae)

#Summary: 
# sagitta area: Wilcoxon test. p = 0.2573489
# sagitta length: t-test. p = 0.379023
# sagitta width: t-test. p = 0.002230046**
# sagitta perimeter: Wilcoxon test. p = 0.175588 (note: a t-test comes up with statistically diff means, but Wilcoxon does not)

# lapillus area: Wilcoxon test. p = 0.5177172

# lapillus width: t-test. p = 0.2221485
